* [Latest WooCommerce Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce)

= Automatic installation =

1. To do an automatic install of our plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.


2. In the search field type “WooCommerce Auction” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found "Ultimate WooCommerce Auction Plugin" by "Nitesh Singh", you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”. 


3. Once installed, simply click "Activate".


4.  After you have setup WooCommerce and activated our plugin, you should add a product. You can do it via Wordpress Dashboard, navigate to the Products menu and click Add New.


5. 	While adding product, choose "product data = Auction Product". Add data to relevant fields and publish it. 

Your auction product should now be ready and displayed under "Shop" page. If you have problems please open discussion in support forum.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation). Kindly follow these instructions for [WooCommerce Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) and then for our plugin.

Then kindly follow step 4 and 5 from "Automatic Installation". 

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
